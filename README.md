Our model's name is **YuE (乐)**. In Chinese, the word means "music" and "happiness." Some of you may find words that start with Yu hard to pronounce. If so, you can just call it "yeah." We wrote a song with our model's name, see [here](assets/logo/yue.mp3).

YuE is a groundbreaking series of open-source foundation models designed for music generation, specifically for transforming lyrics into full songs (lyrics2song). It can generate a complete song, lasting several minutes, that includes both a catchy vocal track and complementary accompaniment, ensuring a polished and cohesive result. YuE is capable of modeling diverse genres/vocal styles. Below are examples of songs in the pop and metal genres. Please visit the [**Demo Page**](https://map-yue.github.io/) for amazing vocal performance.

## News and Updates

* **2025.01.28 🫶**: Thanks to Fahd for creating a tutorial on how to quickly get started with YuE. Here is his [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSMNH9GitbA).
* **2025.01.26 🔥**: We have released the **YuE** series.

<br>



## Hardware and Performance

### **GPU Memory**
YuE requires significant GPU memory for generating long sequences. Below are the recommended configurations:

- **For GPUs with 24GB memory or less**: Run **up to 2 sessions** concurrently to avoid out-of-memory (OOM) errors.
- **For full song generation** (many sessions, e.g., 4 or more): Use **GPUs with at least 80GB memory**. i.e. H800, A100, or multiple RTX4090s with tensor parallel.

To customize the number of sessions, the interface allows you to specify the desired session count. By default, the model runs **2 sessions** (1 verse + 1 chorus) to avoid OOM issue.

### **Execution Time**
On an **H800 GPU**, generating 30s audio takes **150 seconds**.
On an **RTX 4090 GPU**, generating 30s audio takes approximately **360 seconds**.

## Quickstart
Quick start **VIDEO TUTORIAL** by Fahd: [Link here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSMNH9GitbA). We recommend watching this video if you are not familiar with machine learning or the command line.

### 1. Install environment and dependencies
Make sure properly install flash attention 2 to reduce VRAM usage. 
```bash
# We recommend using conda to create a new environment.
conda create -n yue python=3.8 # Python >=3.8 is recommended.
conda activate yue
# install cuda >= 11.8
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For saving GPU memory, FlashAttention 2 is mandatory. Without it, large sequence lengths will lead to out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially on GPUs with limited memory.
# Be careful about matching the cuda version and flash-attn version
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Download the infer code and tokenizer
```bash
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/YuE.git

cd YuE/inference/
git clone https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/xcodec_mini_infer
```

### 3. Run the inference
Now generate music with **YuE** using 🤗 Transformers. Make sure your step [1](#1-install-environment-and-dependencies) and [2](#2-download-the-infer-code-and-tokenizer) are properly set up. 

Note:
- Set `--run_n_segments` to the number of lyric sections if you want to generate a full song. Additionally, you can increase `--stage2_batch_size` based on your available GPU memory.

- You may customize the prompt in `genre.txt` and `lyrics.txt`. See prompt engineering guide [here](#prompt-engineering-guide).

- LM ckpts will be automatically downloaded from huggingface. 


```bash
# This is the CoT mode.
cd YuE/inference/
python infer.py \
    --stage1_model m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-en-cot \
    --stage2_model m-a-p/YuE-s2-1B-general \
    --genre_txt genre.txt \
    --lyrics_txt lyrics.txt \
    --run_n_segments 2 \
    --stage2_batch_size 4 \
    --output_dir ./output \
    --cuda_idx 0 \
    --max_new_tokens 3000 
```

If you want to use music in-context-learning (provide a reference song), enable `--use_audio_prompt`, `--prompt_start_time`, and `--prompt_end_time` to specify the audio segment. 

Note: 
- Music ICL generally requires a 30s audio segment. The model will write new songs with similiar style of the provided audio, and may improve musicality.

- We have 4 modes for ICL: mix, vocal, instrumental, and dual-track. 

- We currently only support mix mode. 

- Dual-track mode work the best, will support in the infer code soon.

```bash
# This is the ICL mode. Currently only mix-ICL is supported.
cd YuE/inference/
python infer.py \
    --stage1_model m-a-p/YuE-s1-7B-anneal-en-icl \
    --stage2_model m-a-p/YuE-s2-1B-general \
    --genre_txt genre.txt \
    --lyrics_txt lyrics.txt \
    --run_n_segments 2 \
    --stage2_batch_size 4 \
    --output_dir ./output \
    --cuda_idx 0 \
    --max_new_tokens 3000 \
    --audio_prompt_path {YOUR_AUDIO_FILE} \
    --prompt_start_time 0 \
    --prompt_end_time 30 
```

## Prompt Engineering Guide
### Lyrics Prompt
1. An example lyric prompt can be found [here](./prompt_examples/lyrics.txt).

2. The lyrics prompt should be divided into sessions, with structure labels (e.g., [verse], [chorus], [bridge], [outro]) prepended. Each session should be separated by 2 newline character "\n\n".

3. **DONOT** put too many words in a single segment, since each session is around 30s (`--max_new_tokens 3000` by default).

4. We find that [intro] label is less stable, so we recommend starting with [verse] or [chorus].

### Genre Tagging Prompt
1. An example genre tagging prompt can be found [here](./prompt_examples/genre.txt).

2. A stable tagging prompt usually consists of five components: genre, instrument, mood, gender, and timbre. All five should be included if possible, separated by space (space delimiter).

3. Although our tags have an open vocabulary, we have provided the top 200 most commonly used [tags](./top_200_tags.json). It is recommended to select tags from this list for more stable results.

3. The order of the tags is flexible. For example, a stable genre tagging prompt might look like: "inspiring female uplifting pop airy vocal electronic bright vocal vocal."

4. Additionally, we have introduced the "Mandarin" and "Cantonese" tags to distinguish between Mandarin and Cantonese, as their lyrics often share similarities.
