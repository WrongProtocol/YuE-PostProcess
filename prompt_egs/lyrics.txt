[Intro]
I don’t think they’re ready yet, they didn’t see it coming
Thought I’d fade away, but I’m just getting started
Pressure makes a diamond, flames ignite a star
Now watch me take the night and tear the sky apart


[Verse]
I was born in the fire, made of sparks and gold
Every step that I take, I break the mold
They try to dim me down, but I only glow
Rising higher than they’ll ever know


[Chorus]
I burn the brightest, light up the sky
Shining like a diamond, I can’t deny
Above the rest, I own the night
No stopping now, I’m set to rise
Oh-oh, I burn the brightest


[Verse]
Every dream that I chase leaves a trail behind
Like a comet racing through space and time
They can watch from below while I touch the stars
I was never meant to stay where they are


[Chorus]
I burn the brightest, light up the sky
Shining like a diamond, I can’t deny
Above the rest, I own the night
No stopping now, I’m set to rise
Oh-oh, I burn the brightest


[Bridge]
No fear, no chains, nothing holding me back
I was made to fly, never fade to black
Let ‘em try, let ‘em chase, but they’ll never catch
I was born to blaze, yeah, I was born to last


[Chorus]
I burn the brightest, light up the sky
Shining like a diamond, I can’t deny
Above the rest, I own the night
No stopping now, I’m set to rise
Oh-oh, I burn the brightest


[Outro]
Watch me rise, watch me shine
Nothing can stop this fire inside
I own the night, I light up the sky
I burn the brightest, I never die
